**OUR MISSION**
> We believe that open satellite data should be accessible to everyone - without barriers. We want to help people get easy access to open satellite data and empower them to draw the right insights.

## Satellite data is only for experts?

Nope, with this project, we are explicitly not addressing developers or scientists. We want to offer something specifically for non-specialist users. So, many more people can benefit from them.

📚 students & teacher<br />
 ✏️ journalists<br />
🔥 climate activists<br />
⛑ humanitarian helpers<br />
👱‍♀️ all citizens

We will provide examples and guides with which you can quickly get started without becoming an expert in the analysis of satellite data. More information on how you can use OpenSpaceData.org for you and your cause will follow.
