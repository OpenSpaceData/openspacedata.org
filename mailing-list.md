Do you want to help out with OpenSpaceData but aren't sure how? Interested in seeing some of the behind-the-scenes work that's going on? We've created a community mailing list that is open to anyone and everyone.

Our mailing list is a public forum, and the mailing list archive is public. 

This list is for the OpenSpaceData community, which includes the people who write, edit, moderate, maintain, publish, design, think about, make plans, sets policy and governance, and otherwise do the work that makes this a community practicing the open source way.

We welcome you to subscribe and start participating, share your ideas, and help improve our products.

You can subscribe to the list at: <a href="https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/openspacedata" target="_blank">https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/openspacedata</a>
