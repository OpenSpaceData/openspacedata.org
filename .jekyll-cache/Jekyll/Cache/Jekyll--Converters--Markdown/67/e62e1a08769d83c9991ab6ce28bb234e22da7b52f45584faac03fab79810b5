<p>Our app is aimed explicitly and exclusively at first-time users, so it does not have to compromise on professional users. What does that mean exactly? Of course, we don‚Äôt want to deliver another tool that takes all the processing and analysis steps off the user‚Äôs hands. A big difference to other tools, besides prioritising the target group on first-time users, is that we want to ‚Äúempower‚Äù people. Not only with the service of providing data, but also with building their own competences.</p>
