<p>Nope, with this project, we are explicitly not addressing developers or scientists. We want to offer something specifically for non-specialist users. So, many more people can benefit from them.</p>

<p>📚 students &amp; teacher<br />
 ✏️ journalists<br />
🔥 climate activists<br />
⛑ humanitarian helpers<br />
👱‍♀️ all citizens</p>

<p>We will provide examples and guides with which you can quickly get started without becoming an expert in the analysis of satellite data. More information on how you can use OpenSpaceData.org for you and your cause will follow.</p>
