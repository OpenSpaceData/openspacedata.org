I"û<p>Our app is aimed explicitly and exclusively at first-time users, so it does not have to compromise on professional users. What does that mean exactly? Of course, we donâ€™t want to deliver another tool that takes all the processing and analysis steps off the userâ€™s hands. A big difference to other tools, besides prioritising the target group on first-time users, is that we want to â€œempowerâ€ people. Not only with the service of providing data, but also with building their own competences.</p>
