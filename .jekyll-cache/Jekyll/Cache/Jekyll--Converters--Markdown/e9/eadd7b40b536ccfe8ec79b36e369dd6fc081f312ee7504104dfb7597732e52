<p>Our mission: We want to democratizing satellite data.</p>

<p>OpenSpaceData.org democratizes satellite data. The aim of the project is to provide a search tool that makes it easier for everyone to find data, regardless of technical or professional knowledge. To this end, freely available satellite data, such as those of ESA or NASA, will be centralized on OpenSpaceData to facilitate access to them via a simple search mask. The tool translates the user’s need into the appropriate parameters of the satellite program. Whether individuals (journalists, scientists, interested citizens) or groups (initiatives, associations): Access to and use of the data increases democratic participation in society.</p>

<p>The 12 Copernicus satellites of ESA alone deliver 250 TB of data per day. The problem: Often technical (APIs) and professional knowledge (determination of sensors, specific parameters, etc.) is needed to retrieve data. OpenSpaceData is intended to provide easy access to this socially relevant information. This ensures that everyone - citizen or NGO - can classify events independently. An example: Thanks to OpenSpaceData, it is possible to access near-real-time data on pollutant emissions. This enables NGOs or journalists to quickly identify impending environmental disasters. The same applies to humanitarian organizations that want to act after disasters such as the explosion in Beirut.</p>

<p>Nope, many more people can benefit from them:</p>

<p>📚 students &amp; teacher<br />
 ✏️ journalists<br />
🔥 climate activists<br />
⛑ humanitarian helpers<br />
👱‍♀️ all citizens</p>
